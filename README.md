This is my version of Conway's Game of Life. I have implemented a start menu where the user can 
customize their simulation by adjusting the size of the map, aswell as the initial amount of 
living cells.

While inside the simulation, I have made so that cells have different sprites depending on 
their lifecycle. Small green ones have just come to life this generation, big green ones have 
been alive for more than one generation, and brown ones have just died. While inside the simulation, 
the user can go back to the start menu by clicking the "Back to Menu" button.
